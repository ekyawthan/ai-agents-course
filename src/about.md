# About This Course

## Author

**Kyaw Mong** is a software engineer and AI practitioner with extensive experience building production AI systems. This course distills years of hands-on experience into a comprehensive learning path for aspiring agent developers.

## Course Philosophy

This course is built on three principles:

**1. Learn by Building**
Every concept is accompanied by working code examples. You'll build real agents, not just read about them.

**2. Production-First**
We don't just teach toy examples. You'll learn reliability, testing, monitoring, and deployment—everything needed for production systems.

**3. Comprehensive Coverage**
From foundations to frontier research, this course covers the full spectrum of agent development in 21,000+ lines of detailed content.

## What Makes This Course Different

- **Complete working code**: Every example runs and can be deployed
- **Real-world focus**: Patterns used in production systems
- **Cutting-edge content**: Latest research and techniques
- **Hands-on capstone**: Build a complete autonomous agent
- **Free and open source**: Available to everyone

## Course Structure

The course follows a carefully designed progression:

**Foundations (Modules 1-2)**: Core concepts and first agent
**Intermediate (Modules 3-5)**: Advanced patterns and production readiness  
**Advanced (Modules 6-8)**: Specialized agents and enterprise scale
**Expert (Modules 9-10)**: Research frontiers and capstone project
